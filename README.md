# passwordGenerator

This Python code generates a secure password based on your chosen length, using a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols. It also allows you to save the generated password with an optional note, storing it in a .txt file on your computer for easy reference.

WARNING: It is not recommended to save important passwords on your computer with this tool, as the passwords are stored as plain text without any encryption.

very soon the update will be released where you can store and manage your passwords in a safe way...
